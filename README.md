MSU's Software Factory Summer App Project- A guide to sorting algorithms for CS students

This application was developed by a small group of high school students under the guidance of two undergraduate students. 
In order for the students to complete this, they needed to be taught java and object-oriented programming using a shell application. This allows them to work exclusively in java while also working in an android development environment. The [JavaLessons](https://github.com/Darnesey/JavaLesson) repository was used as the shell application. They also used [AndroidLesson](https://github.com/Darnesey/AndroidLesson.git) to learn how buttons and activities work.

The purpose of this project was to see how high school students responded to a more engaging learning environment through the use of MSU's Software Factory.
